# Introduction

This exercise is the best way to practice `RMarkdown` [@salinas2020r] now that you have had an overview of how it works. The principle is that you want to produce a copy of this `pdf` file. We provide most of the `R code`, because the scope is to work on the `RMarkdown` [@xie2018r] integration, not on the `R code`. 

# Starters

You want to create a new `Rmarkdown` file and save it in the `Exercise` folder.

# Load packages

What packages will I need? Well I can fill that in later anyway.

BTW: To add a new code chunk the keyboard shortcut is `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `i`.
Or use the insert button on the top left side of this window.
```{r load packages, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)
library(readxl)
library(corrplot)
```


# Research compendium

Let's organize our project. We create a folder called `data` and list the files in the current working folder.

```{r new folder, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
system("mkdir -p ../data")
list.files(path = ".")
list.dirs(path = "..", full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
```

We can now copy the `datasets.xlsx` file (from `data/` in the main folder to the `Exercise/data/` folder).

```{r move file, results=FALSE}
file.copy("../../Tutorials/data/datasets.xlsx", "../data")
```

If you're running an \textcolor{red}{Unix system}, you can also use a bash command (`mv ../../Tutorials/data/datasets.xlsx" ../data`). This is the occasion to try to include a code chunk with another language (i.e. bash)!

<!-- color text for LaTeX output with \textcolor{red}{Unix system} -->
<!-- color text for HTML output with <span style="color: red;">Unix system</span> -->

# Load the project data

We'll use the `mtcars` dataset that we'll load from the `datasets.xlsx` file.
Here we do not provide the code because it is part of the exercise. 

```{r load data, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
my_mtcars <- as.data.frame(read_excel("../../Tutorials/data/datasets.xlsx", sheet = "mtcars"))
```


# Analyze the data

## Get a look at the data

```{r inspect data, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
my_mtcars2 <- within(my_mtcars, {
  vs <- factor(vs, labels = c("V", "S"))
  am <- factor(am, labels = c("automatic", "manual"))
  cyl  <- ordered(cyl)
  gear <- ordered(gear)
  carb <- ordered(carb)
})
summary(my_mtcars2)
```

## First analysis, fuel consumption

I want to assess the motors consumption as a function of the displacement.
Engine displacement is the measure of the cylinder volume swept by all of the pistons of a piston engine, excluding the combustion chambers.

```{r mpg_disp, include=TRUE, fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
plot(mpg ~ disp, 
     data = my_mtcars,
     xlab="Displacement (cu.in.)",
     ylab="Fuel consumption Miles/gallon", 
     ylim=c(10,40))
arrows(x0 = my_mtcars$disp, 
       y0 = my_mtcars$mpg * 0.95,
       x1 = my_mtcars$disp, 
       y1 = my_mtcars$mpg * 1.05, 
       angle = 90, 
       code = 3, 
       length = 0.04, 
       lwd = 0.4, 
       col="red")
```

Whoo, that was **interesting**. Can we conclude that bigger motors consume more fuel?
  
Let's move on to the next analysis.

## Second analysis, is that all?

To assess whether other variables could also explain the consumption I will plot the correlation among each pair of variables in my data.

```{r mtcorplot, fig.align='center', fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
mcor <- cor(my_mtcars)
corrplot(mcor)
```

Whoohoohooo, that plot looks great!

It looks like the **number of cylinders** (cyl), **Gross horsepower** (hp) and the **Weight** (wt. 1000 lbs), could play a role too.

If you are looking for the variables meaning, you can find it [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/mtcars).


## Third analysis, we like camembert, they like pie!

Let's produce a pie chart showing the proportion of cars that have different carb values.

```{r ho_mae, fig.align='right', fig.width=8, fig.height=6, fig.cap="have you ever tried the camenbert pie?"}
#concat the names for the legend
names = as.factor(paste(unique(my_mtcars$carb),"carbs"))
#get the percentages
percent=100*table(my_mtcars$carb)/length(my_mtcars$carb)
pie(x=percent, label=paste(percent, "%"),  col=rainbow(length(names)), 
    main="Percentage of cars per number of carburators" ) 
#add legend
legend("right",legend = names, fill = rainbow(length(names)), cex=0.8)
```


# Let's make sure that my figures have been saved!

```{r check figures}
list.dirs(path = ".", full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
list.files(path = "./Exercise_files/figure-latex/")
```


# Print a nice table of the `mtcars` dataset

Try to reproduce this table with `kable()` and the `kableExtra` functions.

```{r a table, echo=FALSE}
kable(head(my_mtcars), caption = "a wonderful table", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, latex_options = "striped") %>%
  column_spec(5, strikeout = TRUE) %>%
  column_spec(1, color = "pink") %>%
  row_spec(2, color = "white", background = "black")
```




# Insert an image

Insert the image of a cute kitten here :)
Limit the width to 200px and center the picture!
  
```{r cute kitten, out.width = "200px", fig.align="center", fig.cap="A cute kitten"}
knitr::include_graphics("../data/IMG_9769.JPG")
# this is another way to include external images with knitr - it allows you to use 
# the code chunk parameters to place/resize/etc the image
```
